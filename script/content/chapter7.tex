\chapter{Approximation Algorithms}
An algorithm for an optimization problem that yields a ``nearly''
optimal solution is called an approximation algorithm.\\
\emph{Quality of Approximation}\\
$0<C_{n}*$ cost of an optimal solution for an input of size
$n$ (e.g. length of a shortest path). $0<C_{n}$ cost of a solution
produced by an approximation algorithm. If 
$max(\frac{C_{n}}{C_{n}*},\frac{C_{n}*}{C_{n}})=\rho (n)$ then
the algorithm has an approximation ratio of $\rho (n)$.\\
(Remark: $\rho (n) \ge 1$)\\
$\rho (n) = 1$: optimal, $\rho(n) >> 1$: bad approximation\\
Trade-off: Cost of the approximation algorithm vs. quality of approximation.\\
An approximation scheme for an approximation problem is an 
algorithm with 2 inputs: $Problem + \epsilon>0$ such that
the algorithm is a $(1 + \epsilon)$ - approximation algorithm.\\
The approximation scheme is a polynomial time approximation
scheme if for each $\epsilon > 0$ the induced algorithm runs in polynomial time in $n$.
It is fully polynomial if it is polynomial in $n$ and in $1/\epsilon$.
\begin{example}
$O(n^(\frac{2}{3}))$, if $\epsilon' = \frac{3}{4}$ $O(n^(\frac{8}{\epsilon}))$ cost, i.e.
the costs are rising but not by a constant factor.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
$O((1/\epsilon)^2 * n^3)$ fully polynomial. $\epsilon = \frac{\epsilon}{4}
O(16*(\frac{1}{\epsilon}^2 * n^3))$.
\end{example}
\section{Heuristic Approaches}
\emph{Vertex Cover}: Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ without parallel edges and without loops,
we look for a minimal set $V'$ of nodes such that each edge has at least one endpoint in $V'$.
\begin{example*}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/Chapter7_Example1.pdf}
\end{example*}
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $C \gets \emptyset$
\State $E' \gets E$
\While{$E' \neq \emptyset$}
	\State Choose an edge $\{u,v\}$ in $E'$.
	\State $C \gets C \cup \{u,v\}$
	\State Remove all edges from $E'$ with the end point $u$ or $v$.
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{APPROX-VERTEX-COVER($G=(V,E)$)}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\{b,c\}$ Remove from $E'$: $\{b,a\}, \{c,d\}, \{c,e\}, \{b,c\}$
  \item $e,f\}$ Remove from $E'$: $\{e,f\}, \{e,d\}, \{d,f\}$
  \item $\{d,g\}$ $c=\{b,c,e,f,d,g\}$, $E'=\emptyset$ twice as big as the optimum one.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}
APPROX-VERTEX-COVER is a polynomial time 2-approximation ($\rho(n)$) algorithm. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
1. The algorithm runs in polynomial time in the size of the input $G=(V,E)$, because every edge and every node is inspected at 
most once.\\
2. Let $A$ be the set of edges chosen in line 4 of the algorithm. In order to cover the edges in $A$, each vertex cover for $G$, in particular
an optimal vertex cover $c*$, must contain at least one endpoint of each edge in $A$. No two edges in $A$ share an end point. Hence no
two edges in $A$ are covered by the same node in $c*$, hence $|c*|\ge |A|$. In line 4 an edge is chosen, the endpoints of which are not in $C$ and
hence:\\$|C| = 2|A| = 2|c*|$, where $C$ is the calculated set cover and $c*$ is the optimal vertex cover.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Traveling Salesman}
Given a complete undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a cost function $c:V \times V \gets \mathbb{N}$,
find a cycle which visits every node exactly once and is of least cost, where : Let $A \subseteq E$ then
$cost(A) = \sum\nolimits_{e \in A} c(e)$\\
c satisfies the triangle inequality if $c(u,v) \le c(u,v) + c(v,w)$ for any $v,u,w$.
\begin{example*}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/Chapter7_Example2.pdf}
\end{example*}
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Chose a node $r \in V$.
\State Calculate the minimum cost spanning tree starting from r using Prim's algorithm.
\State Let $H$ be the list of nodes that is obtained traversing the tree T in preorder.
\State \Return{H}
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{APPROX-TSP-TOUR($G=(V,E), c$)}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{theorem}
APPROX-TSP-TOUR is a polynomial time 2-approximation algorithm for TSP satisfying the triangle inequality.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
1. Polynomial cost: Because Prim and preorder have polynomial cost.\\
2. Let $H*$ be an optimal tour for $G$. We remove one edge in this cycle, the result is a spanning tree for $G$, called $\widetilde{T}$. 
The $cost(\widetilde{T}) \le cost(H*)$ because $c(e) \ge 0$. A \underline{full preorder run} through a tree is obtained if, after visiting a subtree of $x$,
$x$ is visited again.
\end{proof}
\begin{example*}
a b c b h b a d e f e g e d a
\end{example*}
Every edge of the tree $T$ occurs twice in this list. (TSP tree of Prim).\\
$c(W) = 2*c(T) \le 2 * c(\widetilde{T}) \le 2 * cost (H*)$\\
$W$ visits nodes more than once. We remove these repeated visits and use the triangle inequality to
estimate the costs.\\
a b c a h $\ldots \: \leadsto$ a b c h \ldots\\
The result: a b c h d e f g.\\
This is the preorder-run through $T$.
$\epsilon_{S}(H) \le Cost(W) \le 2 * cost(H*)$ where $\epsilon_{S}(H)$ is the result of the algorithm and $H*$ is optimal.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis and randomized algorithms}

\textbf{Assistant search}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[1] best = 0
  \item[2] for i = 1 .... n do\\
\noindent\hspace*{10mm}	interview candidate i\\
\noindent\hspace*{10mm}	if candidat i is better than best\\
\noindent\hspace*{20mm}		then best:= i\\
\noindent\hspace*{20mm}		employ candidate i (fire previous candidate)\\
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Analysis} of the cost that arise from interviews and hiring.\\
cost of an interview $c{_I}(low)$\\
cost of hiring: $c{_E}(high)$\\
Cost that arise in the worst case $O(n* c{_I} +  m * c{_E}$ ) if m people are hired 
and \\
$O(n * c{_I} +  n *  c{_E} )$ if n people are hired \\
worst case: if candidates show up in the order: worst first, \ldots best last

\textbf{Indicator Variable}
Let S be a set and $A \subseteq S$ and execute the indicator variable.\\

$ X(s)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl} 1, if s\in A \\ 0, else \end{array}\right .$

$E[x{_1}] = \sum\limits_{x} x Pr(X{_A}=x) = Pr(A)$

\textbf{Example}
Throw a coin n times.
$ X(s)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl} 1, \mbox{ if in the i-th throwing head is shown} \\ 0, \mbox{  otherwise } \end{array}\right .$

$S = {(a{_1},\ldots,a{_n}) : a{_i} \in {H,N}}$,
Let X be the random variable that describes how often ``H'' appears when you throw n-times.

$X:\{H,N\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
$X=\sum x{_i}$

The expected number of ``H''\\

$E[X] = E[\sum x{_i}] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n E[x{_i}] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2} = \frac{n}{2}$

\textbf{Example Hiring:}\\

$ X{_i} = \left\{\begin{array}{cl} 1, \mbox{ if the candidate is hired} \\ 0, \mbox{  else } \end{array}\right .$

$X= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x{_i}$ describs how many candidates are hired\\

$E[X] =  E[\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x{_i}] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n E[x{_i}]$\\

$E[X{_i}] = $ Probability that the i-th candidate is hired.


Candidate i is hired if this person is better than the first i-1 candidates. If the order in which people are chosen is random, each of the first i candidates is the best with same probability.
So $E[x{_i}] =\frac{1}{i}$\\
$E[X] =  \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} = \ln n + O(1)$ 


\begin{lemma}
If the order in which the candidates appear is random then the average cost of finding a suitable employee is
$ O( c_E *  \ln n + C_I * n)$
\end{lemma}

\textbf{Question:}
How can we know that the order is random ?\\

\subsection{Randomized Algorithms}
In order to guarantee randomness of the input, we randomize it. 

\begin{example}{Hiring}
Given the list of the n candidates, use random numbers to select a candidate for an interview.
$RANDOM(a,b)$ produces an integer z with  $a \leq z \leq b$ where all numbers in this interval are equally probable. 
$RANDOM(0,1)$ produces 0 or 1 with equal probability $\frac{1}{2}$
$RANDOM(3,7)$ produces 4 with probability $\frac{1}{5}$ \\
\end{example}
  
\textbf{Randomized-Assistant Search}
\begin{enumerate}[label={\arabic*.}]
 \item Permute the list of candidates using a  random number generator
 \item best = 0
 \item ... as before
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}
The expected cost for hiring using the randomized assistant search algorithm is \\
$O( c_E * \ln n + C_I * n)$
\end{lemma}
How to randomize an in input of n elements [A[1...n]]? \\
