\section{Two processor scheduling}\index{Two processor scheduling}

Given:\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Two identical agents/processors
  \item Collection of n jobs or taskstogether with a directed acyclic graph with n nodes which correspond to the jobs, that describe the preceedence among the jobs.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{example}
2 Graphics missing

\end{example}

How can the jobs be scheduled on the two processors such that the jobs are completed as quickly as possible?

\textbf{Solution}:\\
using matching!\\
\underline{But:}\\
for three processors the problem is NP-Complete.\\

To solve the two processors problem we proceed as follows. We construct a graph $G*$ thathas the same nodes as $G$ and there is an edge {x,y} in $G*$ if and only if there is no path from x to y in $G$ and no path from y to x in $G$.

\underline{1. Observation:}\\
if we have a schedule we can obtain a matching. If the schedule is optimal the matching is of maximal cardinality.

\underline{2. Interessting:}\\
We can use matching of maximal cardinality to produce a schedule that is optimal.\\

Let S be a set of nodes with indegree 0. Let $M*$ be a matching of max. cardinality for $G*$. Apply the following rules repeatly:\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If there is an unmatched node in S then schedule it. Remove it from G.
  \item If there is a pair of jobs in S that are unmatched in $M*$then we schedule this pair in the output and delete the two nodes (corresponding to the jobs) in G.
\end{enumerate}

If neither rule 1 nor rule 2 applies and there are still jobs left to be scheduled then we know that S contains only nodes thatare matched
and for every node in S its partner ($M*$) is not in S.\\

$J{_1} \in S$ ------$M*$------
$J'{_1} \notin S$\\

$J{_2} \in S$ ------$M*$------
$J'{_2} \notin S$\\

Observation:\\
$\not\exists$ path $J_{1}$ to $J_{2}$
